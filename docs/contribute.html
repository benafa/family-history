title: How to contribute? 
---

If you're wondering how you can contribute, here are a few suggestions:
<ul>
    <li> <b> Did you notice anyone missing from the family trees? </b> I would be happy to add them. For people from generations ago, it will be helpful to provide documentation showing their relationships. This leads me to the next suggestion....
    </li>
    <li> <b> Do you have any primary source material? </b> This includes documents such as marriage certificates, birth records, obituaries, newspapers, memorial cards, obituaries, and photos. The website would greatly benefit from your contributions.
    	<ul>
    		<li>What about secondary sources? Secondary sources can be a great way of finding hints, but their accuracy can come into question. In order to keep the website as accurate as possible, I kindly request that that you refrain from providing information from secondary sources (such as Worldgenweb). Thanks for understanding! </li>
    	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> <b> Have you seen any mistakes? </b> Firstly, my apologies! Please don't hesitate to bring any errors to my attention.
    </li>
    <li> <b> Lastly, please consider spreading the word about Colombo Chetty Genealogy's website, <a href="https://colombochetty.com/" style="color:#0077CC;text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold;"> https://colombochetty.com</a>. </b> You will help more people find out about their ancestry and potentially fill in gaps in the website.
    </li>
</ul>

Please send any questions or content contributions to <a href = "mailto: ben@colombochetty.com" class="link">ben@colombochetty.com</a>. Thank you for your support and help in expanding the project!
