Mater Dolorosa Church was built in 1820, and plaques on the church have the names **P.B. Anandappa (born 29 May, 1787)** and **D.B. Anandappa (born 9 June, 1816)**. The role of Muppu is said to be passed from father to son, so it is possible P.B. Anandappa and D.B. Anandappa are ancestors of Anthony Xavier Anandappa.
