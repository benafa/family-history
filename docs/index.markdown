Anthony Xavier Anandappa was born on **January 24th, 1873** to Anthony Anandappa and Anthonia Wijeratnam. In the 1890s, he married Anna Pieris Tavarayan, daughter of <a href="/family-history/newspaper/saviel-pieris-tavarayen.html" class="link">Saviel Pieris Tavarayan</a> and Cecilia Rodrigo. Anthony Xavier and Anna had 6 children together: 
- 3 daughters: Mary Louise, Cecilia Johanna Josephine, and Mary Rose (*pictured below*)
- 3 sons: Anthony Joseph Nicholas "Joe", Ignatius Boniface "Bonnie", and Aloysius Gonzaga.

Mater Dolorosa Church was built in 1820, and plaques on the church have the names P.B. Anandappa (born **29 May, 1787**) and D.B. Anandappa (born **9 June, 1816**). The role of "Muppu" is said be passed from father to son, so it is possible P.B. Anandappa and D.B. Anandappa are ancestors of Anthony Xavier Anandappa.
