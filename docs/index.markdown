Mater Dolorosa Church was built in 1820, and plaques on the church have the names **P.B. Anandappa (born 29 May, 1787)** and **D.B. Anandappa (born 9 June, 1816)**. The role of Muppu is said to be passed from father to son, so it is possible P.B. Anandappa and D.B. Anandappa are ancestors of Anthony Xavier Anandappa.

Anthony Xavier was elected the first president of the **Colombo Chetty Association** in 1919, and held this role unitl 1932. Around 1930, his brother Joseph Caitan passed away, and Anthony Xavier took care of two of Joseph Caitan's children - Bede Leonard (still living) and Pius Anthony Xavier. 

Anthony Xaiver passed away at age 78 on **Jan 2, 1952**. While he was the eldest in his family, only one of his 8 siblings - Laura Angelina - is known to have outlived him. After his passing, his son Bonnie became Muppu of Mater Dolorsa Church.
