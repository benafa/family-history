My name is Ben Anandappa, and I am researching and compiling the genealogy of the Colombo Chetty people. My hope is that this website will help others learn about their heritage and remind us of how connected we all are! 

Please <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contribute" class="link">submit this form</a> or send an email to <a href = "mailto: ben@colombochetty.com"  class="link">ben@colombochetty.com</a> for any questions or contributions. I'm happy to add additional photos, documents or other information to the website. 

**Some background on my interest**  <br />
My father, Romello Anandappa, is of Colombo Chetty ancestry - his parents were Benedict "Benson" Anandappa and Annabelle "Rajie" Casie Chetty. My sister, Annabelle, and I were named after his parents!

After a few trips to Sri Lanka as a kid in the 2000s, I was inspired to learn more about our family history, and my dad helped me put together an initial family tree from his memory. After that initial attempt, I put the project away in a metaphroical draw - I was 13 after all, and it wasn't easy to seek out more information.

For the next decade or so, the project was all but forgotten, until a chance encounter led to my sister discovering we had extended family in Chicago - the descendants of Ernest and Estelle Anandappa. I later  met Gerard Saverimuttu as well, who explained that he was the son of my great-grandmother's sister! Given I was now connected with more relatives (and I was older!), I was inspired to expand the family tree I made as a kid. 

In Februrary 2023, I visited Sri Lanka after 13 years. I was on a mission to meet more of my extended family, and I was fortuante enough to meet three of my oldest living relatives - Anthony Eubaldus (Tony) Anandappa (age 97, my grandfather's brother), Helen Juliana Rodrigo-Muniarem-Perumal (age 99, my grandmother's first-cousin), and Bede Leonard Anandappa (age 102, my great-grandmother's first-cousin)

This is an on-going project with many more avenues for research. It could not be possible without the suppoprt and positive reception of everyone, so I wanted to say...
