My name is Ben Anandappa, and I am researching and compiling the genealogy of the Colombo Chetty people. My hope is that this website will help others learn about their heritage and remind us of how connected we all are! 

Please email [ben.anandappa@gmail.com](ben.anandappa@gmail.com ) for any questions or contributions. I'm happy to add additional photos, documents or other information to the website. 

**Some background on my interest**  <br />
I grew up in Perth with my sister, Annabelle, and my parents Romello Anandappa and Nooshini Ramasamy. My dad named us after his parents, Benedict "Benson" Anandappa and Annabelle "Rajie" Casie Chetty.

After a few trips to Sri Lanka as a kid in the 2000s, I was inspired to learn more about my family history, and my dad helped me put together an initial family tree from his memory. After that initial attempt, I put the project away in a metaphroical draw - I was 13 after all, and it wasn't easy to seek out more information.

The project was all but forgotten until a chance encoutner let to my sister discovering we had extended family in Chicago. 

As young adults, my sister and I moved from Australia to the United States. When my sister was interviewing for medical school in 2013, she happened to be at the same interview as a relative, Michael Fernandopule, but neither of them knew they were related at the time! Michael went back to his mum, Bernadette Fernandopulle (nee Anandappa), and he told her about the encounter. She was certain there was a relationship, so they reached out to Annabelle, and this was how we first came to know of our extended family living in Chicago!

I moved to Chicago in 2018, and I would often meet with this extended family. We would regularly try to work out the relationship between us, but never fully documented it...

In July 2022, at Miranda Anandappa's wedding in Colombus, I met Gerard Saverimuttu. He said we were closely related and explained that he was the son of my great-grandmother's sister! Given this close relationship, I was inspired to go back to the family tree I made as a kid and work on expanding it. 

I spoke to Uncle Gerard many times after that, and I was so impressed by his memory! From there, I continued to reach out to more relatives, as well as using online newspapers to conduct research. 

In Februrary 2023, I visited Sri Lanka after 13 years. I was excited to meet more of my extended family, and I was fortuante enough to meet three of my eldest living relatives - Anthony Eubaldus (Tony) Anandappa (age 97, my grandfather's brother), Helen Juliana Rodriog-Muniarem-Perumal (age 99, my grandmother's first-cousin), and Bede Leonard Anandappa (age 102, my great-grandmother's first-cousin)
