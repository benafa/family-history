I'm excited to unveil the new <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dynamic" class="link">Dynamic Descendant View</a> on Colombo Chetty Genealogy! 

</p>

<h2>From Static to Dynamic</h2>
<p>
  In the past, the website showcased the family trees of key ancestors - these trees were static in that they lacked the ability to refocus the view to a different person's tree. Feedback from users highlighted a desire for a more flexible way to connect with our ancestry. 
</p>
<p>

  With this feedback in mind, the family tree visualization has been enhanced to offer a richer, more interactive experience.
</p>


<h2>Introducing the Dynamic Descendant View</h2>
<p>
The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dynamic" class="link">Dynamic Descendant View</a> provides a straightforward and interactive way to explore family trees. By clicking on a name, you can easily navigate through ancestral lines. 
</p>
<p>
This is a change from the static view, where clicking a name just opened a profile. Now, clicking a name refocuses the tree on the selected individual, simplifying the process of discovering and learning about our relatives.
</p>

<h2>How to Use the Dynamic Descendant View</h2>
<p>
    Here’s how you can dive into this new feature:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Directly</strong>: 
            <ol>
                <li>Navigate to the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dynamic" class="link">Dynamic Descendant View</a>  page.</li>
                <li>Select a person from the dropdown or click on a name in the current view to explore their descendant tree.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>From a Profile</strong>: 
            <ol>
                <li>Go to the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/people" class="link">List of People</a> and use the Sort/Filter option to find someone.</li>
                <li>Visit their profile </li>
                <li> Click on “View Tree” which will direct you to the Dynamic Descendant View</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
