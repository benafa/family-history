Each week, I plan  to post a photo of Colombo Chetty ancestors and discuss the relationships that exist between those in the photo. For the very first post, I'll start with the wedding of my grandparents...

You may recognize this from the banner on the front page of <a href="https://colombochetty.com" class="link">colombochetty.com</a>! Thank you to <b>Genevieve Rodrigopulle</b> for providing this photo and for helping to identify everyone. I was so excited when I first saw this photo in February 2023 as it was the first time I saw my grandfather &#x1F92F;

Without further ado, let's get into the <i>"who's who" </i> of the photo: 

<h3> <i> Back Row </i> </h3>
- &#x1F469;&#x1F3FE; <b>Annette Anandappa</b> is the daughter of Enid Anandappa & Theodore "Tiddy" Anandappa, and she is Rajie's first cousin;
- &#x1F468;&#x1F3FE; <b>Tony Anandappa</b> is Benson's brother;
- &#x1F468;&#x1F3FE; <b>Pius Anandappa</b> is the son of Joseph Caitan Anandappa & Magdalene Tavarayan, and he is the first cousin of both Rajie's mother and Benson's mother;
- &#x1F469;&#x1F3FE; <b>Hyacinth Casie Chetty</b> is Rajie's sister, and she later married Pius!

<h3> <i> Front Row </i> </h3>
- &#x1F467;&#x1F3FE; <b>Mano Casie Chetty</b> is a daughter of Rajie's brother Joy;
- &#x1F467;&#x1F3FE; <b>Carmel Anandappa</b> is a daughter of Rajie's sister Queenie;
- &#x1F466;&#x1F3FE; <b>Frank Anandappa</b> is Carmel's brother;
- &#x1F467;&#x1F3FE; <b>Romany Anandappa</b> is a daughter of Benson's sister Anna;
- &#x1F466;&#x1F3FE; <b>Elmo Casie Chetty</b> is a son of Rajie's sister Beda.

That's all for the wedding party. Let's talk more about the bride and groom themselves...

<h3> <i> The Couple </i> </h3>
- &#x1F470;&#x1F3FE; <b>Rajie's</b> parents were Mary Clara Anandappa and Abraham Peter Casie Chetty. Rajie was her nickname - her full name was Annabelle Mary Nathalia Rasappopathy. It appears that she got one of her middle names, Nathalia, from Mary Clara's mother Nathalia Canjemenaden;
- &#x1F935;&#x1F3FE; <b>Benson</b> was the son of Mary Louise Anandappa and Philip Raphael Anandappa. His full name, Anthony Xavier Benedict, is likely a combination of both of his grandfathers - Mary Louise's father Anthony Xavier and Philip Raphael's father Peter Benedict.

Benson and Rajie would go on to have four children together: Charmaine, Oswin, Fiona and Romello (my dad!).

<h2> Site updates </h2>
A few important site updates...
- &#x1F389; We have reached over 50 members since launch!
- &#x1F310; Some members reached out to provide additional people to the trees and these are reflected in the website. We're now almost at 1,300 people in the database! 
- &#x270F; A few misspellings were brought to my attention and these have been updated. 
- &#x1F5D1; The "Photo" tab has been removed as photos will appear in blog posts (like this one) instead. 
- &#x1F50D; There is now a tab for <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/people" class="link">"People"  </a> to make the page easier to find. This page is a good starting point to find profiles and their corresponding trees.   

Further corrections and additions are more than welcome, and these contributions are invaluable towards the mission of creating an accurate, well-documented genealogy of the Colombo Chetty Community! 

If you have any <b> primary source material </b> (e.g. marriage certificates, birth records, obituaries, newspapers, memorial cards, obituaries, photos), the website would greatly benefit from including these. I would be happy to hear from you at <a href = "mailto: ben@colombochetty.com"  class="link">ben@colombochetty.com</a>.
