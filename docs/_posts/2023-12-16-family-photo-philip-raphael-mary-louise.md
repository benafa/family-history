<h2> The Couple </h2>

Philip Raphael Anandappa and Mary Louise Anandappa were united in marriage on October 18, 1917. 

Philip Raphael was born in 1891 to Peter Benedict Anandappa and Savaria Laity Ramenaden. His wife, Mary Louise, was five years junior, born around 1896, and she was the eldest daughter of Anthony Xavier Anandappa and Anna Pieris Tavarayan. 

<h2> Wedding Newspaper Article </h2>
I'm excited to share this Ceylon Observer extract detailing their wedding in 1917!

YESTERDAY’S WEDDINGS.

<p class="old-newspaper-style">
The wedding was solemnized yesterday morning at the Mater Dolorosa Church, New Chetty Street. The bridegroom was Mr. Philip R. Anandappa of the Land Settlement Department, and the bride was Miss Mary Louise, daughter of Mr. A. X. Anandappa, the Fort Broker, and Mrs. Anandappa, of "Lauradale", New Chetty Street. After the ceremony at the Church, the parents of the bride held a reception at their residence. At the event, the Hon. Mr. Justice T. E. de Sampayo K.C. proposed a toast to the health of the newlywed couple.

<h2> Marriage Certificate </h2>

Below is a copy of their marriage certificate:

</div>

The witnesses to their wedding were Lawrence Benedict Fernandopulle and Caitan Louis Anandappa, eldest brother of Philip. The couples' relation to Lawrence Benedict Fernandopulle is not currently known.  

This document was also helpful in confirming the names of the fathers of Philip and Mary - Peter Benedict Anandappa and Anthony Xavier Anandappa, respectively. 

Interestingly, the certificate lists St. Lucia’s Cathedral as the wedding venue, contrasting the newspaper's mention of Mater Dolorosa Church.

<h2> Connection to Mater Dolorosa </h2>

Both Philip Raphael and Mary Louise have strong ties to Mater Dolorosa Church. 

Philip was a grandson of Domingo Benedict Anandappa, who has a plaque that still stands at Mater Dolorosa Church today. In addition, Mary's father, Anthony Xavier, was Muppu of the church from around 1916 to his passing in 1952. 

Both Domingo Benedict's plaque and Anthony Xavier's Muppu certificate can be found on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/" class="link">front page</a>. 

<h2> Later Life </h2>
Mary Louise and Philip Raphael were married for 29 years until 1946 when Philip sadly passed away, leaving behind his wife and young children. Mary would go on to live to around age 81, passing away in 1977. Throughout her life, she had the joy of attending the weddings of each of her children - check out their wedding photos below:
